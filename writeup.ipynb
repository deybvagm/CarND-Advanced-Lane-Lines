Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",

    "I found several issues with the my project. First I feel the perspective parameters `src` nad `dst` are not robust enough for every scenario. Second the sliding window parameters could fail to detect the lane lines and in some cases the diverge from the real pixels. There is also a shortcoming with sliding window so far because for every frame I use this approach.\n",
    "There is also issues with fitting the lane lines, sometimes they are not parallel to each other and that causes that the curvature is also different each of the two lines\n",

    "Outlier detection techniques could be useful as well as more sofisticated method that sliding window for subsequents frames as we saw in the course `search around poly approach`\n",
